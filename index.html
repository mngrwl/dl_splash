        <p>
            In December 1938, Germany, when Hitler's Nazi empire was at its peak
            before the war, a German chemist named Otto Hahn did an experiment with
            his assistant Fritz Strassman. They struck a Uranium atom with a
            neutron, and found that the reaction produced Barium. "Oh that's neat,"
            they thought.
          </p>

          <p>
            They wrote a paper describing the results and shared it with one of
            their friends, a Jewish physicist named Lise Meitner (a woman who had
            recently been persecuted by the Nazis and was on the run). She read the
            paper and discussed it with her nephew.
          </p>

          <p>
            As they read Hahn's paper, something stood out to them. They did some
            calculations... and realized that Hahn had performed the most
            terrifyingly powerful chemical reaction known to humanity at the time
            without even realizing it.
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>He had split the atom</em> — discovering nuclear fission and
            launching the age of atomic weapons.
          </p>

          <p>
            They immediately shared this with other scientists, kicking off a chain
            of events that ultimately led to Albert Einstein sending a warning to
            President Roosevelt of the USA, who later announced the Manhattan
            Project.
          </p>

          <p>
            You should definitely read more about this exciting story, but one thing
            you should notice is the extent to which science and
            technology relies on inter-disciplinary knowledge-sharing and good 
            discussion around new research. The more diverse people read research papers 
            and share ideas, the faster the world will progress.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today, scientific discourse is broken.
            Scholars around the world are separated by various barriers of economics, different
            languages and fields of study, holding back countless potential collaborations
            and inter-disciplinary breakthroughs.
          </p>

          <p>
            All this further discourages millions of people from even <em>attempting</em> to
            engage with high-quality research.
          </p>

          <p>
            With DenseLayers, we're building the best space in the world for 
            high-quality discussions and knowledge-sharing around frontier sciences 
            and engineering.
          </p>

          <p>
            We are also developing a new generation of tools to enable every scholar
            to feel welcome, regardless of their level of expertise in a particular domain or which language they speak.
          </p>

          <p>
            We invite you to join us, and hope to build a kind, helpful and courageous
            community together.
          </p>
